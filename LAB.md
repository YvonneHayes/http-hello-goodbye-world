======

Create an http server that either responds with "hello world" or "goodbye world".

## Directions

* Use the Node.js `http` module to create an http server. 

* Your server needs to provide at least two possible responses based on one or more of the following:
	* Url (path)
	* Query parameters
	* Http Verb
	
* Your reponse also needs to include some information based on the original request (e.g. show the actual requested url)
	
* You are free to use other response messages and variations as long as they are distinguishable. Plain text or html is fine.
	
* No tests are required, we will cover E2E Http testing tomorrow.

* As there are no tests, make sure to describe how to alter response based on request in `README.md` 

## Bonus
